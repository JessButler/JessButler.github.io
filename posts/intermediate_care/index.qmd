## Healthcare in your community

<br>
The [Scottish Government states](https://www.gov.scot/publications/maximising-recovery-promoting-independence-intermediate-care-framework-scotland/)  

â€œwe must deliver person-centred **community-based services** that will help people to live healthy, independent lives in the way they want, where they want, and when they want."

## Between GP care and hospital care
<br>

"**Intermediate Care** can help shift the balance of care away from hospital and can reduce the need for alternative, longer-term care services, such as home care, or permanent admission to a care home."

## Pathways into and out of hospital
<br>

Patients get care before or after a hospital stay at home, at a community hospital, or at a care home

## Intermediate care in NHS Grampian
<br>

Most intermediate care takes place in small community hospitals.

## Our research goals were to measure
<br>

Who receives intermediate care?  
How much care is for people coming from the big hospitals?  
How much care is for people coming from home?  
What are the medical needs of the patients?  
How has intermediate care changed over time?  
Are there differences across locations?  

## Who did we study?
<br>

- Any person age 50 and above  
- Who was admitted any time in 2018 through 2023  
- To any of the 17 intermediate care settings  
[11 community hospitals in Aberdeenshire, 4 in Moray, Rosewell House, or Hospital-at-Home (home care delivered by NHSG consultants)]

## Who used intermediate care?
<br>

In the five years 2018-2023, **13,000 people** were admitted to an intermediate care setting. Some people had more than one admission, so overall there were **24,000** admissions.

## Community Hospital admissions are down
<br>

Since the pandemic, admissions to community hospitals are down steeply.
