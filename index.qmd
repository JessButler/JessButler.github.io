I'm the Lead Data Scientist at NHS Grampian and a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Aberdeen. <br>

### Networked Data Lab

I run Grampian's  [collaboration](https://www.health.org.uk/funding-and-partnerships/the-networked-data-lab) with The Health Foundation and four other NHS centres across the UK. This is a six-year project working to reduce health inequalities.  

Our team's specialty is working with big, messy, high-security health and social care data. My focus is creating *useful* analysis for policy makers and care providers.

Right now we're working on understanding inequalities in children's mental healthcare. 

Read a [blog post](https://jessbutler.github.io/posts/pis/) about mental health prescribing to children. Or a [post](https://jessbutler.github.io/posts/referrals/) about children's treatment by specialist mental health doctors.
Check out our [briefing paper](https://www.health.org.uk/publications/reports/improving-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-services) for policy makers.
Or wade into our academic [research article](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.14.22276082v1).


### Public Health

I also make open-source tools about local communities and their needs for NHS Public Health.

[Funding in priority neighbourhoods](https://jessbutler.github.io/priority_neighbourhoods/)


### Research Culture

I'm a huge nerd for open science and good research culture. 
Scientists should be (but aren't) rewarded for doing rigorous science. [I recently gave evidence](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/6626/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) about this to the House of Commons Science & Technology committee.  

Interested in improving research quality? I run the Aberdeen Open Research Working Group.  All are very welcome to join - just drop me an [email](mailto:jessicabutler@abdn.ac.uk). There's also lots of resources on my [uni website](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/iahs/people/profiles/jessicabutler).

### Coronavirus

During the pandemic, I led a Chief Scientist's Office project to [protect patients with serious medical conditions](https://www.cso.scot.nhs.uk/rapid-research-in-covid-19-programme/abncovidportfolio/) from coronavirus.  

We advised the NHS on how to protect these patients as they receive necessary care during the pandemic. Read the [briefing paper](https://www.health.org.uk/publications/reports/assessing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-population), [research](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.09.21263026v1) or a few [blog](https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/exploring-demographic-variation-in-groups-advised-to-shield) [posts](https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/hospital-use-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-population).

### Data Provenance

In 2022, I finished a Wellcome Trust Open Research project to design safe ways to [be open while using high-security patient data](https://wellcome.ac.uk/grant-funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/open-reproducible-analysis-and-reporting-data). We automated the capture and reporting of complex data provenance without compromising patient data privacy.
