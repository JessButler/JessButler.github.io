    "text": "I’m the Lead Data Scientist at NHS Grampian and a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Aberdeen. \n\nNetworked Data Lab\nI run Grampian’s collaboration with The Health Foundation and four other NHS centres across the UK. This is a six-year project working to reduce health inequalities.\nOur team’s specialty is working with big, messy, high-security health and social care data. My focus is creating useful analysis for policy makers and care providers.\nRight now we’re working on understanding inequalities in children’s mental healthcare.\nRead a blog post about mental health prescribing to children. Or a post about children’s treatment by specialist mental health doctors. Check out our briefing paper for policy makers. Or wade into our academic research article.\n\n\nPublic Health\nI also make open-source tools about local communities and their needs for NHS Public Health.\nCheck out:\nPoverty and emergency hospital admissions\nOvercrowding and vaccine needs\nFunding in priority neighbourhoods\n\n\nResearch Culture\nI’m a huge nerd for open science and good research culture. Scientists should be (but aren’t) rewarded for doing rigorous science. I recently gave evidence about this to the House of Commons Science & Technology committee. You can also watch a spicy symposium I hosted: Academic Journals are Broken. Let’s Build a Better Scientific Record.\nInterested in improving research quality? I run the Aberdeen Open Research Working Group. All are very welcome to join - just drop me an email. There’s also lots of resources on my uni website.\n\n\nCoronavirus\nDuring the pandemic, I led a Chief Scientist’s Office project to protect patients with serious medical conditions from coronavirus.\nWe advised the NHS on how to protect these patients as they receive necessary care during the pandemic. Read the briefing paper, research or a few blog posts.\n\n\nData Provenance\nIn 2022, I finished a Wellcome Trust Open Research project to design safe ways to be open while using high-security patient data. We automated the capture and reporting of complex data provenance without compromising patient data privacy.\n\n\nContact\nEmail\nUniversity website\nGoogle Scholar\nOrcid\nGithub\nMastodon\nTwitter"

    "text": "We looked at all children living in the NHS Grampian region (Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray). There were 100,000 people under age 18 in total.\nWe measured how many prescriptions these children had for mental health medicine. This included medicine for ADHD, anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and psychoses.\nWe asked these questions\n\nWhat kind of medicine for mental health do children take?\nAre they taking more of these medicines than before?\nAre boys and girls given different medicine?\nAre younger children given different medicine than older children?\n\nWhat did we find?\n\n\nPrescriptions to children up 60%\n3% of all children had a prescription for mental health medicine in 2021.\nSince 2015, the number of prescriptions has risen from 24,000 to 37,000 per year.\n\nSleep prescriptions are up 91%\nAntidepressant prescriptions are up 59%\nADHD prescriptions are up 45%\nAnti-psychotic prescriptions are up 35%\n\n\n\n\nBoys get far more prescriptions than girls\nBoys get 70% of all prescriptions for mental health medicine. This difference is largest in the youngest children. Boys get the vast majority of prescriptions given to primary schoolers. Girls’ prescriptions increase rapidly after age 13.\n\n\n\n\nYoung children take ADHD medication & older children take anti-depressants\nWe looked at the kinds of medicine given to children of different ages.\nPrimary schoolers take mostly ADHD and sleep medication. By the end of secondary school, many more take anti-depressants.\nComparing boys and girls shows that boys are given mental health medicine at younger ages, mostly for ADHD and sleep.\nGirls get many more prescriptions after puberty, mostly for anti-depressants.\n\n\n\n\nChildren living in poverty take much more mental health medicine\nWe compared children living in the poorest areas to those living in the wealthiest areas. Children living in poor neighbourhoods had twice as many prescriptions for mental health problems.\nFor every 100 children living in the poorest areas, there were 34 mental health prescriptions every year. In the wealthiest areas there were 17 prescriptions.\n\n\n\nTell me more\nThis research was done as part of the Networked Data Lab with partners at The Health Foundation.\nWilliam Ball led this analysis with me. Other contributors from the Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science were: Corri Black, Sharon Gordon, Bārbala Ostrovska, Shantini Paranjothy, Adelene Rasalam, David Ritchie, Helen Rowlands, Elaine Thompson, Magdalena Rzewuska, and Katie Wilde.\nFull details are in our publication Inequalities in children’s mental health care: analysis of routinely collected data on prescribing and referrals to secondary care.\nPolicy recommendations from our work are in the briefing Improving children and young people’s mental health services"

    "text": "We looked at all children living in the NHS Grampian region (Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray). There were 100,000 people under age 18 in total.\nWe studied children’s referrals to see specialist doctors in out-patient clinics.\nWe asked these questions\n\nHow many children are referred to mental health specialists?\nAre more being referred than before?\nWhich children are accepted for specialist treatment?\nAre boys and girls treated differently?\nAre older and younger children treated differently?\n\nWhat did we find?\n\n\nMany children need specialist mental health care\n3% of all children were referred to see a mental health specialist in 2020.\n\n\n\nOlder children’s mental healthcare needs are rising\nTeenagers are being referred to see mental health specialists more often. Referrals are up about 30% since 2015.\nReferrals for primary school children have not risen. Referrals for children under 5 are down.\n\n\n\n\nMental health specialists treat mostly teenagers\nWe measured which children’s referrals for specialist care were rejected.\n20% of secondary schooler’s referrals for mental healthcare are rejected. This hasn’t changed over time.\n50% of referrals for young children are rejected. There has been is a large increase in rejection of young children since 2015.\nThe children treated in the specialist mental health clinics now average 1.5 years older than in 2015.\n\n\n\n\nBoys are being treated less by mental health specialists\nIn 2015, mental health specialists treated equal numbers of girls and boys. Now boys are being referred less and rejected more. There are now twice as many girls being treated by specialists as boys.\n\n\n\n\nChildren living in poverty need more specialist care younger\nWe compared children living in the poorest areas to those living in the wealthiest areas. Children living in poor neighbourhoods had twice as many referrals for specialist mental health care.\nThe average age of a child’s first referral to specialist is over a year younger for those living in the most deprived areas.\n\n\n\nTell me more\nThis research was done as part of the Networked Data Lab with partners at The Health Foundation.\nWilliam Ball led this analysis with me.
